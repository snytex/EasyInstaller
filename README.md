# EasyInstaller

Easy Installer is a free Open Source Tool, which provides you with a menu of many direct download links. This is especially useful, if you just reset your pc and you want to install important things quick. This will get updated frequuently.

Note: At the moment this only supports 64-Bit Operation systems!

# EDIT: This is really old and at the time where I made this, I was still learning python so pls dont blame me for this shitty repo :p
